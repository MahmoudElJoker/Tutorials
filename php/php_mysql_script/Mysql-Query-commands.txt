- BIT : the same thing as TINYINT
- BOOL : as above
- SMALLINT : 32,768 to-32,767     takes 2 bytes
- MEDIUM INT : 8,388,608 to -8,388,608  takes 3 bytes
- INT : 2^31 to -2^31 -1     takes 4 bytes
- INTEGER : the same thing as INT
- BIGINT : 2^63 to -2^63 -1  takes Big integers 
with 8 bytes size

2-Floating-Point Data Types
- FLOAT : ±1.175494351E-38 to ±3.402823466E+38   takes 4 bytes
- DOUBLE : ±1.7976931348623157E+308  to ±2.2250738585072014E-308 takes 8 bytes
- PRECISION : as above
- REAL : as above
- DECIMAL : varies cuz this a floating-point number that stored as char.
The range depends on M, the display width.  takes M+2
- NUMERIC : as above
- DEC : as above
- FIXED : as above

2- String Types
- CHAR : A Character string with a fixed length
- VARCHAR : A character string with a length that's variable
- BLOB : Can contain 2^16 bytes of data

- ENUM : A character string that has a limited number of total values,

- SET : A list of legal possible character strings.
Unlike ENUM, a SET can contain multiple values in comparison to the one 
legal value with ENUM.
