// document.write() function used to print anything in javascript ,it's like echo in php
document.write("MiDo");

/* variables in Javascript the only difference between vars in JS and PHP , in php we use $ before the var name 
but in javascript we use var before the variable name 
 for example */
 
var myname = "MiDo";
var myage = 19;
var status = true;
document.write("My Name is " + myname + " and My age is " + myage);
//also can use a very useful function called alert
//and this function used to show a message in the browser for user...
alert("My Name is " + myname + " and My age is " + myage);

</script>
<br /> <br />

<script>
//very important I can write a variable name in javascript without using var keyword
// and I think I will use it win work with real application to make the code hard to read
//for ex :-
name="mido";age=15;bool=true;document.write(name+" "+age+" "+bool);
