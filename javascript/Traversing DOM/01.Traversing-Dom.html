A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your
program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It
helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to
divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.

JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when
the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called
 an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event.
 Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window,
  resizing a window, etc.
