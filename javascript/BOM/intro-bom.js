BOM / Browser Object Model.
Definition & explanation :-
BOM stands for Browser Object Model. It’s a nice name for something that’s not formally
defined. It’s a collection of browser-related properties and methods, such as available
screen size or the status bar. Most of these properties are available as globals such as
innerWidth, although you most often see them used as properties of the window object
(e.g., window.innerWidth). BOM hasn’t been standardized for a long time, so as you
can imagine, there are some differences across browsers. HTML5 started to codify
common behavior among browsers, including the common BOM objects.
