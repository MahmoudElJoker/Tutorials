<h1>MiDo Dev</h1>
<p class="start">Welcome in <strong> MiDo Dev</strong> for learning programming language We offer many tools that help students and who intresting in programming.</p>
<img class="img" src="mido.jpg" />
<h2>About us</h2>
<p class="about">MiDo Dev is a platform designed by MiDo the idea was about 5 years and now it becomes so popular because of you all! <em>We've make it to help people around
the world</em> to understand <big>Computer Science</big> topics in easiest way.</p> <br />
<p class="testing">
MiDoDev is the best web site in the internet that provide free courses and tools you can use every thing here free , also you can earn money if you have
some knowledge by uploading tutorials, then may you ask your-self how! it simple even with the website free each tool members are add
gives us money then you wanna to share that money with you all! cool is it!.

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, 
on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources 
(e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) 
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management 
effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is 
composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.
On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, 
such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed 
through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin 
or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
Resource pooling. The provider’s computing resources are pooled to 
serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different 
physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned 
according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location 
independence in that the customer generally has no control or 
knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but 
may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction 
(e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned 
and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly 
outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, 
the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to 
be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and 
optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability1 at 
some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service
 (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).
 Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported,
 providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
