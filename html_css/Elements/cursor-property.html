<p>Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned 
and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly 
outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, 
the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to 
be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and 
optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability1 at 
some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service
 (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).
 Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported,
 providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.</p>
